title: "How does Score work?"
---
Score is an open source, platform-agnostic, container-based workload specification that allows developers to define their workloads once and then use a Score Implementation CLI to translate it to multiple platforms, such as Helm, Docker Compose, or Google Cloud Run. Score aims to reduce developer toil and cognitive load by only requiring a single YAML file that works across multiple platforms, and is designed to be applied to multiple environments to reduce the amount of configuration needed.
